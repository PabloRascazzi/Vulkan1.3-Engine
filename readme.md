Description: This project is a continuation of my university Honour's Project as a way to continue learning about the Vulkan API.<br>
Author: Pablo Rascazzi

### Instructions
* **Clone/download** repository
* **Build** solution in either *Debug x64* or *Release x64* configuration
* **Copy** the **dynamic libraries** to the appropriate *Debug* or *Release* build directories.
	* Copy the following libraries into `.\x64\Debug\`:
		* `.\Engine\vendor\SDL\bin\SDL2.dll`
	* Copy the following libraries into `.\x64\Release\`:
		* `.\Engine\vendor\SDL\bin\SDL2.dll`
* **Run** python script `compileShaders.py` in the project's root directory
  * Change \``COMPILER_PATH`\` variable from `compileShader.py` if necessary
* **Run** solution

### Important Information
* The project is tested on an **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080ti** on driver version **528.49** and **531.79**. 
* The application will crash with driver version **531.18** and **531.29**.
